## Introduction 

The aim of this project was to deploy a ready-made Flask application onto a Virtual Machine that made use of a managed database solution and could be tested automatically.  

This application uses four services throughout the full stack application that communicate together and also a database.  

 

## Project Planning 

Jira Boards 

Project link above and also here.  

We created a Jira Kanban project in order to create a methodical and organised plan for completing the project within our pair. The attached photos give a quick insight into the layout of Jira and show how it separates the tasks into bitesize junks that we could take on one at a time. We generated ‘Sprints’ that kept our time well managed, we knew exactly what we needed to work on and when. We also were able to priorities he more important tasks that needed to be completed first.
